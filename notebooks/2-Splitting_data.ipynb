    "In the real world, we rarely get the luxury of neatly packaged training and testing sets. Instead, we're usually handed one massive, unstructured dataset. The key to success? How we split that data.<br>\n",
    "The way we divide our data hinges on a critical question—are we aiming for interpolation or extrapolation?<br>\n",
    "• Interpolation means our model will predict within the range of its training data—like filling in the gaps of a familiar puzzle.<br>\n",
    "• Extrapolation pushes the model beyond its comfort zone, asking it to generalize to entirely new scenarios—like predicting tomorrow’s weather based on historical patterns.\n",

    "* BACKUP YOUR DATA (3-2-1 rule)<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "DESCRIBE YOUR DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine Friendly: Describe your dataset with a metadata standard for discovery.\n",
    "* Human Friendly: Describe your variables, so your colleagues will understand what you meant. Data without good metadata is useless. Give your variables clear names.\n",
    "* Do not leave cells blank -use numeric values clearly out of range to define missing (e.g. '99999') or not applicable (e.g. '88888') data anddescribe these in your data dictionary.\n",
    "* Convert your data to open, non-proprietary formats \n",
